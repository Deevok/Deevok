- 👋 Hi, I’m @Deevok aka Devon Slavkovsky
- 👀 I’m interested in making a huge impact. I have my HAM radio amateur extra license which I would love to take advantage of using digital modes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, QGIS, more advanced MS Office stuff at work, and will eventually tackle Java and C++ for a thorough knowledge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something simple as I scaffold the skills to secure sanity in my coding sessions.
